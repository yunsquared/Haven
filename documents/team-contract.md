# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**


1. To what goals do we all commit?

  - All team members should make some contribution to all parts of the project
  - All team members should have experience designing, sketching, coding and testing.
  - All team members should communicate with each other to discuss the project or to resolve conflicts
  - All team members should submit their work before the deadlines


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

  - Team members should respond to messages or other forms of communication within 24 hour time frame
  - Team members must try their best to complete the tasks that they are responsible for or reach out to other team members for help at least two days before the submission deadline.
  - All members must communicate and critique others’ work with thoughtfulness and respect


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

  - We will try to communicate through our team group chat (imessage) on a daily basis for the working process on different parts of the project
  - We will try to meet during the lab section and on the weekend before each milestone’s due date to discuss our project and to work on it together (or have extra meetings as needed)

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
  - Our main point of contact is one of the co-presidents of Haven, Zoë Roberts. If there is information that Zoë cannot provide, she is able to refer us to other members of Haven.
  - Firstly, we will let our client say everything they need and then after we get down their needs we will get their wants.
  - We will give our client regular updates so we can see if we are going in the right direction with the project. This includes sending sketches of proposed _big_ changes and screenshots after we make substantial changes.
  - We do not want to overwhelm our client so we will create in entirety and ask our clients their opinions about the design, rather than checking in before every small change or asking for specific details on our client’s preferences before trying anything.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

  *Team coordinator*
  Responsible for scheduling initial meetings, keeping team on track if necessary, and helping outline specific agenda items to complete for team
  *Team mediator*
  Will be responsible for deciding whether to revisit team contract if situation necessitates it, and serving as first point of contact for team members should inter-team conflict occur
  *Team reviewers*
  Will be responsible for checking team’s work before submission, and reviewing for any additional uncaught errors and determine if more work needs to be done
  Two team members will be designed as team reviewers


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

  - We will try to address the root problem that is interfering with our team member’s work before jumping to conclusions, imposing harsh consequences, or taking the conflict outside of the group.
  - Here are some examples of good ways to bring up disagreements or issues with our team members’ quality of work:
    - “Hey I get where you’re coming from, but I think we should take a step back to reassess”
    - “How do people feel about dividing the tasks differently so that everyone is more equipped to contribute?”
    - “Have you been running into problems with XXX? If you help me with YYY I can work on that problem with you.”


7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

  If there is any disagreement or discourse, we will try to resolve our issues by simply referring to this document. We will look back to this document to find our conditions and see exactly what we said in the past. If we still need more information after looking at this document, we can bring up the specific issue to have a discussion that meets our team guidelines and possibly reassess the contract.


8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

  When a team member fails to abide by the agreements outlined in this contract, they will first be given a warning. The second time an issue occurs, all team mates will convene to revisit this contract and go over specific areas that were violated.


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

  - At every meeting, we should make sure to discuss what we like about the work we have achieved so far, and make sure none of our conversations are entirely critical or negative. This will help keep up morale and put our issues with the work into perspective.
  - Work hard, play harder :)


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
